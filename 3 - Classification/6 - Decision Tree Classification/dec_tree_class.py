# Decision Tree Classification in Python using Scikit-Learn
# Program wrote by Igor Melo, Octobre 2020
# This program has as objective predict a possible costumer to a SUV model.
# The model is based in a dataset composed by Age, Salary, Purchase 
# (yes or no /0 or 1).

# Importing Libraries

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing Dataset and Splitting Independent and Dependent Variables

dataset = pd.read_csv('Social_Network_Ads.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

# Splitting Dataset into Train and Test set

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 0)

# Feature Scaling

# In this problem we need to employ feature scaling due to the scale difference between
# independent variables (Age and Salary) and dependent variable (Purchase: yes or no / 0 or 1)

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.fit_transform(X_test)

# Training our Decision Tree Classification model

# The Decision Tree Classification works like the Regression model (CART is about both methods).
# First we split the data set in a certain point. From this, we make the same procedure trying to 
# find to each branch a good standard deviation and a minimal entropy (can be another mathematical
# method). Once time that we defined the the branches, we are able to classify a new data point. 
# This method has your relevance, but nowadays  there are some optimizations for it.

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=0)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Here we utilize the class tree and the object DecisionTreeClassifier. The chosen parameters
# are criterion and random state. The first parameter give us two option (Gini, Entropy) and
# the second fix the seed of the random generator. In respect to criterion, Gini measures the 
# quality of split and Entropy the gain of information. If you want to know what are the better,
# you must try all parameters.  


# Making a single prediction

# As we already know, after training the model, we can make predictions.
# Attention (We need to employ Standardscaler because the entry values are Age and Salary in the normal scale)

print(classifier.predict(sc.transform([[30, 80000]])))

# Checking test results

# One way to verify your results is to print the values predicted next to the test values

y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
print(np.concatenate((y_pred.reshape(len(y_pred),1), y_test.reshape(len(y_test), 1)),1))

# Checking confusion matrix and accuracy score

# As we can see in the last print, our model presents good previsions, but we can find bad results.
# Is important to know how efficient is our model, to do it, we can utilize matrix confusion and accuracy score
# In the first we are going to see a matrix that contains the number of good and bad predictions referent to each class.
# In the second tool we have the ratio of good prevision called accuracy score.

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
conf_mat = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(conf_mat)
print(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

# ================================================================================================
# In this model we employed Decision Tree Classifier. The accuracy is good, but is not the better
# in comparison to other non-linear models. We can see in the graphic the the model separates the 
# space in regions. But some relations that we can see in other examples is more complicated here.
# We will to see others examples based in this method that give us better results.
